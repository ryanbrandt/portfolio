# Portfolio

Its my (nth) portfolio page and hopefully my last because these things are kind of just for kicks and not super useful.

This iteration I went ahead and built a whole CMS with a RESTful backend so I hopefully never touch this thing again because its really just so I can flex on my friends and every weekend I redo this damn thing I realize I probably could have spent my time working on something thats actually interesting.
