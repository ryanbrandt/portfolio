        As you might have guessed, you've reached my <i>personal</i> page.

        Here, you'll find my (hopefully) updated resum√©, my personal projects,
        along with some brief summaries, and some means to get in touch.

        Oh and my blog if you feel like reading about some of my personal
        interests within and outside of tech.
